## When there's no response from me for a while

My notification is flooding and I often overlook your email, ping, review request, etc.
When I don't respond for more than a week, feel free to ping me again or [open an issue here](https://github.com/JohnTitor/JohnTitor/issues),
I'll prioritize it.

## Donate <img height="23px" width="23px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JohnTitor/JohnTitor/main/paimon.gif">

Thanks you for all my sponsors!

You can support me via GitHub Sponsors: <https://github.com/sponsors/JohnTitor>

<details><summary>Why do I need your help?</summary><div>

Currently my life is _unstable_ as I cannot work as much as I'd like
due to the mental condition/disorder, so your help is definitely helpful
to continue my FLOSS journey.

But the donation isn't the only way to support me.
You can use/star the projects that I'm involved in, follow my GitHub account, and do various things related to my contributions. It will motivate me in my future contributions.
