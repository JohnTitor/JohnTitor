## My Open Source Work

Check out [my GitHub Sponsors profile page](https://github.com/sponsors/JohnTitor) for details!

### üíñ Why Your Sponsorship Matters

The crates I maintain have been downloaded **over 1.7 billion times** and power countless applications worldwide. Despite this massive impact, all of my open source work is done **in my spare time, unpaid**.

Your sponsorship directly enables me to:
- Dedicate more hours to maintenance and reviews
- Respond faster to critical issues and security patches  
- Develop new features and improvements
- Keep the Rust ecosystem reliable and growing

Every contribution, regardless of size, makes a real difference in sustaining this work.
